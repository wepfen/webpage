Actually student in computer science and cybersecurity school [Ecole 2600](https://ecole2600.com/).
I like learning new things and playing CTFs with my team [0xA28](https://ctftime.org/team/272956).

I like [sexy JDM cars](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/de/7d/2bde7d14133968f97d6c4dd898edb989.gif) 
and am a drift enthusiaist and is interested in automobile cybersecurity (haven't started learing this tho).
